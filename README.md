Welcome to my final project repository! Here is a guide to what's inside:

The **current** folder holds the final versions of content for my game: the game map, character guide, and the game itself.

The **game pitch** folder holds the materials I made back before my game pitch for HW7.

The **room scenes** folder holds the maps I drew myself, and the AI generated ones. As stated in my final essay, I wasn't able to get my maps integrated in Bitsy but wanted to show them to display the work I put in. 

And in addition to all these, I have my game, marked as **farnsworth_manor.html**. 


How to play the game:

Download the farnsworth_manor html onto your desktop. Once in your files, open it with a browser, preferably Firefox because there have been some issues with the game's text. 

Once in the game, the question mark icon in the starting room (the foyer) will give a prompt of who you are, and what to do. 

The entrances/exits to the different rooms are marked with gold tiles.
